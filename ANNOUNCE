Tk::Pod is a graphical user interface for viewing and browsing perl's
POD documentation.

Features include:
	o Interface to perlindex full text POD search added
	  (you need to install the perlindex distribution aka
           Text::English on CPAN).
	o Supports single or multiple POD windows.
	o Primitive Tk/More widget with '/', 'n', 'N', 'j', 'k'
	  bindings
	o Tree view of available PODs

The current version uses Pod::Simple as POD parser (thanks to Sean M.
Burke!).
