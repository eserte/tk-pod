Tk::Pod

This is a graphical user interface for viewing and browsing perl's Pod
documentation.

To install, type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Windows users should replace "make" with "nmake" unless using a
cygwin-compiled or MinGW-compiled perl.

Features include:
	o Interface to perlindex full text Pod search added
	  (you need to install the perlindex distribution aka
           Text::English on CPAN).
	o Supports single or multiple Pod windows.
	o Primitive Tk/More widget with '/', 'n', 'N', 'j', 'k'
	  bindings
	o Tree view of available Pods
