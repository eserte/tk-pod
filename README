Tk-POD distribution is derived from tkpod and Tk::Pod.pm of
Tk402.003 distribution.  All bugs are mine.  Gifts to the
original author Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>.

Added features compared to the version in Tk402.003:

	o Interface to perlindex full text POD search added
	  (you need to install perlindex distribution).
	o L<man/sec> and L<show|man/sec> supported	 
	o Primitive Tk/More widget with '/', 'n', 'N', j, k
	  bindings
	o Added Open and Help menu item
	o Don't open new Toplevel window for new selected POD
	  so 'feel' is more like in WWW browsers
	o Added Popup menu for 'Back' 'Reload' 'Edit' 'Search'
	o CDE default font support
	o better lookup of Tk docs with -tk switch
	o Added some POD to tkpod Tk::Pod and Tk::Pod::Text

The distribution includes a patch for Tk/Text.pm  (already in
Tk402.004). When you get an error about 'tagPrevrange' apply it.

Known problem with Tk800.000 and Tk800.0_01:

        Bad option `Name' at ../tk8/blib/lib/Tk/Menu/Item.pm line 48.
         at ../tk8/blib/lib/Tk/Widget.pm line 225

    A quick fix/workaround is to patch Tk800.000 and 0_01 from
    Slaven RetiSlaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>

Win95/NT Users:

	I guess that perlindex (relies on perls dbm support) and
	'Edit' are too unixish to work out of the box.  But rest
	of tkpod functionality should work.

History:

version 0.7

	Tk/Pod/Text.pm
		o Links don't change font size in =head and
                  =item commands
		o Support L<man/"head*"> and L<man/item>
		  (/"head" and /item still don't work when
		  new Pod widget should is opened (<2> or
                  <Shift-1>)
		o Support L<showthis|man/sec> (new in 5.004_05
		  to be and > 5.005_56)

	Tk/Pod.pm
		o Don't pack menubuttons for Tk800.*. (Thanks
		  to Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>)
		o 'Help/Usage' works when installed (also Win*?)

	Tk/More.pm
		o better h,j,k,l bindings scroll regardless of
		  'insert' position
		o insertCursor is invisible (well zero width)
		o insertCursor off time set to 0 sec to switch
		  of blinking (see text.n doc)
		o fixed packing so entry does not fanish for
		  small More widgets

version 0.6

	o fixed 'Quit' error
	o Pod widgets created from another Pod widget have now
	  same parent as Pod widget that created them

version 0.5

	o tkpod: added -tk switch so, Pod will be found
	  even if Tk:: or Tk/ prefix is omitted.

	o Fixed wrong $VERSION of Tk::Pod

version 0.0401

	o For 2 button mouse owners:
		<Shift-ButtonRelease-1> does same
		as <ButtonRelease-2>: load doc into
		new window.

	o Fixed Tk::Pod version to be higher than in
	  Tk402.003 so CPAN.pm gets the right distribution

	o more TODO entries :-)

version 0.04

	o applied Tk/Parse.pm patch of Slaven Rezic
	  <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> to fix problem
	  triggered by perlfaq4.pod
	o Allow upcase chars in E<> as: Auml, Ouml,...
	o Shift-Button-1 was used to open new window
	  on L<>.  Now it's Button-2
	o added 'szlig' to E<>
	o Added more example POD markup to Tk/Pod/Text for
	  verification

version 0.03

	o fixed warn on =for.  Perl Data Language has lots
	  of them
	o use alpha FcyEntry widget if available
	o Tk/More status line: flat<->sunken, disabled<->normal
	
version 0.02

	o use CDE default fonts if available
	o first go on Tk::More widget
	o use perlindex full text index if available

version 0.01

	o derived from Tk402.003 tkpod Tk/Pod.pm
	o Extracted Tk::Pod::Text  from Tk::Pod  and use ROText
	o 'better than nothing POD' for tkpod, Tk::Pod, Tk::Pod::Text.pm
	o Added tkpod Help menu
	o L<> in blue
	o Button-* load POD in same window (with shift in separate
	  window)
	o tkpod now exits when last Pod widget is closed
	o quick and dirty 'back' history.
	o Added Popup menu: back, reload, edit
	o removed Autoloader and sub old_process
	o some other little fixes I can't remember right now
