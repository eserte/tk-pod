Tk-POD distribution is derived from tkpod and Tk::Pod.pm of
Tk402.003 distribution.  All bugs are mine.  Gifts to the
original author Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>.

Added features compared to the version in Tk402.003:

	o Interface to perlindex full text POD search added
	  (you need to install perlindex distribution).
	o L<man/sec> and L<show|man/sec> supported	 
	o Primitive Tk/More widget with '/', 'n', 'N', j, k
	  bindings
	o Added Open and Help menu item
	o Don't open new Toplevel window for new selected POD
	  so 'feel' is more like in WWW browsers
	o Added Popup menu for 'Back' 'Reload' 'Edit' 'Search'
	o CDE default font support
	o better lookup of Tk docs with -tk switch
	o Added some POD to tkpod Tk::Pod and Tk::Pod::Text
	o Section menu (thanks to Slaven Rezic)


There are no known Problems with recent Tk800 releases.

Win95/NT Users:

	I guess that perlindex (relies on perls dbm support) and
	'Edit' are too unixish to work out of the box.  But rest
	of tkpod functionality should work.

History:

        o fixed VERSION problem: 1.14+2 < 3.14
        o Added 'standard perl' COPYRIGHT notices to modules

		added support simple =head3 support
		(treated like =head2)
	o Parse.pm

		  (/"head" and /item still don't work when
		  new Pod widget should is opened (<2> or
                  <Shift-1>)

		  small More widgets

	o Pod widgets created from another Pod widget have now
	  same parent as Pod widget that created them

	  even if Tk:: or Tk/ prefix is omitted.

		<Shift-ButtonRelease-1> does same
		as <ButtonRelease-2>: load doc into

	  Tk402.003 so CPAN.pm gets the right distribution

	o more TODO entries :-)

	  <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> to fix problem
	  triggered by perlfaq4.pod

	o Shift-Button-1 was used to open new window
