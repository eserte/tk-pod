Stuff in Tk-POD distribution is derived from tkpod and Tk::Pod.pm
of Tk402.003.  All bugs are mine. Gift and other goodies to the
original author Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>.

I added a feature just when I needed them.  So code/implementation
is not in the state I would like.  Nevertheless it's quite more
useful IMO :-)

	o Interface to perlindex full text POD search added
	  (you need to install perlindex distribution).
	o Added some POD to tkpod Tk::Pod and Tk::Pod::Text
	o Added Open and Help menu item
	o Don't open new Toplevel window for new selected POD
	o Added Popup menu for 'Back' 'Reload' 'Edit' 'Search'
	o CDE default font support
	o Very Primitive Tk/More widget with '/', 'n', 'N'
	  bindings
	 
The distribution on includes a patch for Tk/Text.pm (already posted
to ptk list). So when you get an error about 'tagPrevrange' apply it.

If you find a bug please check the TODO file if it's not already
known.  Please consider to send any nontrivial patch to the
perl/Tk mailing list

	ptk@lists.stanford.edu

to prevent duplicate work and to get the snow ball running :-)

Comments are always very welcome.

Win95/NT Users:

	I guess that perlindex (relies on perls dbm support) and
	'Edit' are too unixish to work out of the box.  But rest
	of tkpod functionality should work.

History:

version 0.0401

	o For 2 button mouse owners:
		<Shift-ButtonRelease-1> does same
		as <ButtonRelease-2>: load doc into
		new window.

	o Fixed Tk::Pod version to be higher than in
	  Tk402.003 so CPAN.pm gets the right distribution

	o more TODO entries :-)

version 0.04

	o applied Tk/Parse.pm patch of Slaven Rezic
	  <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> to fix problem
	  triggered by perlfaq4.pod
	o Allow upcase chars in E<> as: Auml, Ouml,...
	o Shift-Button-1 was used to open new window
	  on L<>.  Now it's Button-2
	o added 'szlig' to E<>
	o Added more example POD markup to Tk/Pod/Text for
	  verification

version 0.03

	o fixed warn on =for.  Perl Data Language has lots
	  of them
	o use alpha FcyEntry widget if available
	o Tk/More status line: flat<->sunken, disabled<->normal
	
version 0.02

	o use CDE default fonts if available
	o first go on Tk::More widget
	o use perlindex full text index if available

version 0.01

	o derived from Tk402.003 tkpod Tk/Pod.pm
	o Extracted Tk::Pod::Text  from Tk::Pod  and use ROText
	o 'better than nothing POD' for tkpod, Tk::Pod, Tk::Pod::Text.pm
	o Added tkpod Help menu
	o L<> in blue
	o Button-* load POD in same window (with shift in separate
	  window)
	o tkpod now exits when last Pod widget is closed
	o quick and dirty 'back' history.
	o Added Popup menu: back, reload, edit
	o removed Autoloader and sub old_process
	o some other little fixes I can't remember right now
