Tk::Pod

This is a graphical user interface for viewing and browsing perl's Pod
documentation.

To install, type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make demo
	make install

Windows users should replace "make" with "nmake" unless using a
cygwin-compiled or MinGW-compiled perl.

Features include:
	o A standalone Tk pod viewer: tkpod
	o Interface to perlindex full text Pod search
	  (you need to install the perlindex distribution aka
           Text::English from CPAN).
	o Supports single or multiple Pod windows.
	o Primitive Tk::More widget with '/', 'n', 'N', 'j', 'k'
	  bindings
	o Tree view of available Pods

The original Tk::Pod module was written by Nick Ing-Simmons
<nik@tiuk.ti.com>. Former maintainer was Achim Bohnet. Current
maintainer is Slaven Rezic <slaven@rezic.de>. Pod::Simple support is
by Sean Burke. Please send bug reports, patches and comments to the
current maintainer.
