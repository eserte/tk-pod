=head1 TODO

Scratch pad of bugs, missing features, and misbehaviors
collected during I used tkpod.

=head2 BUGS

=head3 Tk::Pod

=over

=item *

What about the reported error on Suse Linux (see rt.cpan.org)? I can't
reproduce this bug...

=item *

Dump does not always work on a RedHat 8.0 system, so I had to use a
workaround.

=item *

SE<lt>E<gt> seems often to be ignored. May be a core Tk::Text bug (i.e.
C<< -wrap => "none" >> in tags being sometimes ignored)

=item *

PodText: interrupt process() if another file is loaded... Sometimes
strange things may happen like all text is underlined. C<< => >>
hopefully fixed now.

=item *

for Windows: check whether Tk::More/Tk::Tree match the system
background colors

=item *

maybe special handling for Tk::Pod::FindPods under Mac OS X is
necessary (pod directory is /System/Library/Perl/pods)

=item *

Correct title is not displayed if function pod in displayed in a new
window or when navigating in the history back or forward to a function
pod.

=item *

C<< $podtext->configure(-file => ...) >> does not work always as
expected. When set from a command line argument, then one expects to
use the name of a module in perl's pod path (specified without .pm or
.pod extension) or a (relative) path to a file (with extension). Example:

    cd ~/src/bbbike
    tkpod ESRI/esri2bbd.pl
    * now click on bbbike link => bbbike itself will be loaded, not bbbike.pod
      because of a -f test in findpod

=item *

Do not move focus if already in PodText's search entry.

=head3 Tk::Pod::Cache

=head2 WISHLIST

=head3 Tk::Pod

=over

=item *

cleanup search interface to perlindex. Maybe patch Ulrichs TPJ example
code for nroff pages to allow both POD and MAN.

=item *

add meaningful regression tests

=item *

use some kind of access control for the -s option

=item *

new menu entry with a link list (e.g. all LE<lt>...E<gt> and everything
looking like a module /\w+::\w+/)

=item *

maybe put the removed WWWBrowser (as a new Launcher::WWW) code again
to Tk::Pod::Text

=item *

option for interleaving POD and code

=item *

show "No documentation found for "..."" if there's no pod in the file
(just like perldoc)

=item *

maybe you something selectable and copyable (e.g. Tk::ROText) in the
About dialog

=item *

support for the new Pod::Index module (similar to the fulltext search)

=item *

some kind of stylesheet support

=back

=head3 Tk::More

=over

=item *

Tk/More status bar:  filename  %   line x

=item *

more 'more' like key bindings to Tk::More.

=item *

More.pm: search should scroll per page

=item *

search policies: regexp, glob, incremental (as in xmore)
and 'normalized' as in perlindex.  Should go into it's own
Tk::Text::Util.pm module

=item *

after switching between case sensitive/insensitive highlightning
should be updated immediately

=item *

scrolling is not as exact as it shoule be (i.e. scroll forw, then
scroll back will not get to the same position as before)

=item *

use Tk::HistEntry for search entry

=item *

implement isearch

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Cache

=over

=item *

use a LRU cache with $MAX_CACHE documents

=item *

maybe do not cache small documents at all

=item *

store modtime of POD files and flush cache automatically if the file
changed

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Tree

=over

=item *

Should I include something similar to perlfunc for perlfaq (perldoc
-q)? Maybe a new menu item "Search FAQ"?

=item *

Implement C<-rememberopen> in C<Fill> method.
