Scratch pad of bugs, missing features, and misbehaviors
collected during I used tkpod.


o Tk8 font handling is much better for a new PodText

o PodText should not manipulate toplevel title
  in sub filename (called by Tk::parse)

o replace Tk::Parse with Pod::Parser
  Hmmm... lets wait for Pod::Base/Simplify

o Parse.pm: problems if parsing POD with DOS newlines on a Unix system

o Stephen J. Lusol suggested:
	... It would be nice if Tk::Pod had a
	Print feature in the File menu....

  open (|lpr -h) print $t->get(1.0,end) (too bad)
  pod2man | groff -man | lpr -h
  pod2ps
  wasn't there a ptk lpr wrapper!???

  config via ENV var or is there a Preferences menu out there?
  (maybe use Tk-getopt and set useful defaults for missing cmd
  line params?)

  Version 1.0: Now there is a Print menu entry, but the configuration
  questions are still open.

o perlfunc.pod complains 3 times that -X should be i[BC]<-X>
  Maybe add silent and 'lint' mode (but output to another
  text widget)

o after =back missing horizontal white space, see 'sz'
  in Tk::Pod::Text.pm POD

o Bug: C<> in (e.g.) MakeMakers DESCRIPTION section is in bold
       roman instead of Courier. After this page is loaded all
	pages show this bug  (Tag order?)

o Bug: S<> e.g., in SYNOPSIS of perl manpage ignored

o cleanup search interface to perlindex.  Maybe patch Ulrichs
  TPJ example code for nroff pages to allow both POD and MAN.

o add meaningful regression tests

o create 'AsToplevel' similar to 'Scrolled'

o Tree: re-read tree, invalidate cache

o PodText: interrupt process() if another file is loaded...

o use some kind of access control for the -s option

o Double-2 over non-links should load a pod into a new window (like
  Button-2 opens a new window, and Double-1 recognizes pods in
  non-links)

o new menu entry with a link list (e.g. all L<...> and everything
looking like a module /\w+::\w+/)

o zoom +/- (like in tkrevdiff)

o ignore =comment sections

o for Windows: check whether Tk::More/Tk::Tree match the system
background colors

o if called from the full text search dialog: maybe jump to the first
  occurence of the term in the pod

o maybe special handling for Tk::Pod::FindPods under Mac OS X is
  necessary (pod directory is /System/Library/Perl/pods)

Tk::More:

o Tk/More status bar:  filename  %   line x

o more 'more' like key bindings to Tk::More.

o More.pm: search should scroll per page

o search policies: regexp, glob, incremental (as in xmore)
  and 'normalized' as in perlindex.  Should go into it's own
  Tk::Text::Util.pm module

o after switching between case sensitive/insensitive highlightning
  should be updated immediately

o scrolling is not as exact as it shoule be (i.e. scroll forw, then
  scroll back will not get to the same position as before)
