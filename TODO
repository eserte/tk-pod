Scratch pad of bugs missing features and misbehavior I've
found during the usage of tkpod:

o replace Tk::Parse with Pod::Parser subclass
  Hmmm... lets wait for Pod::Base/Simplify

o Stephen J. Lusol suggested:
	... It would be nice if Tk::Pod had a
	Print feature in the File menu....

  open (|lpr -h) print $t->get(1.0,end) (too bad)
  pod2man | groff -man | lpr -h
  pod2ps
  wasn't there a ptk lpr wrapper!???

  config via ENV var or is there a Preferences menu out there?
  (maybe use Tk-getopt and set useful defaults for missing cmd
  line params?)

o perlfunc.pod complains 3 times that -X should be i[BC]<-X>
  Maybe add silent and 'lint' mode (but output to another
  text widget)

o after =back missing horizontal white space, see 'sz'
  in Tk::Pod::Text.pm POD

o add all ISO-Latin1 char names to Tk/Pod/Text $translate
  see HTML::Entities

o Set title to name of pod instead of Pod. (But on reload
  title is file).  Some time // prefix, sometimes /./ slips
  in. (Tk403.002 Toplevel patch posted so 'Pod' as title is fixed)

o Tk/More status bar:  filename  %   line x

o Bug: C<> in (e.g.) MakeMakers DESCRIPTION section is in bold
       roman instead of Courier. After this page is loaded all
	pages show this bug  (Tag order?)

o Bug: S<> e.g., in SYNOPSIS of perl manpage ignored

o Bug: works: perl Makefile.PL; make; make test
       but this does not: perl Makefile.PL; make test

o MM workaround: 'Writing Makefile for Tk::Pod' is not
  writen out two times. It's just a side effect of the setup

o add 'more' like key bindings to Tk::More. Especially
  'up' 'down' should scroll independent where the cursor is.

o better history support:
	o disable 'back' menu item on first hist entry
	o add forward

o search policies: regexp, glob, incremental (as in xmore)
  and 'normalized' as in perlindex.  Should go into it's own
  Tk::Text::Util.pm module

o add section jumps as for <manpage/section>

o cleanup search interface to perlindex.  Maybe patch Ulrichs
  TPJ example code for nroff pages to allow both POD and MAN.

o tkpod: Split 'Quit' menu in 'Close' and 'Exit'

o add 'daemon' mode to Tk::Pod so Pod stuff run only once
  per user (send/receive => -T clean)

o add meaningful regression tests

o create 'AsToplevel' similar to 'Scrolled'
