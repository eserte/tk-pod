Scratch pad of bugs, missing features, and misbehaviors
collected during I used tkpod.

o Bug: S<> seems often to be ignored. May be a core Tk::Text bug (i.e.
  -wrap => "none" in tags being sometimes ignored)

o cleanup search interface to perlindex.  Maybe patch Ulrichs
  TPJ example code for nroff pages to allow both POD and MAN.

o add meaningful regression tests

o Tree: create new menu entry for re-reading tree, invalidate cache

o PodText: interrupt process() if another file is loaded...

o use some kind of access control for the -s option

o Double-2 over non-links should load a pod into a new window (like
  Button-2 opens a new window, and Double-1 recognizes pods in
  non-links)

o new menu entry with a link list (e.g. all L<...> and everything
looking like a module /\w+::\w+/)

o for Windows: check whether Tk::More/Tk::Tree match the system
background colors

o if called from the full text search dialog: maybe jump to the first
  occurence of the term in the pod

o maybe special handling for Tk::Pod::FindPods under Mac OS X is
  necessary (pod directory is /System/Library/Perl/pods)

o maybe put the removed WWWBrowser code again to Tk::Pod::Text

Tk::More:

o Tk/More status bar:  filename  %   line x

o more 'more' like key bindings to Tk::More.

o More.pm: search should scroll per page

o search policies: regexp, glob, incremental (as in xmore)
  and 'normalized' as in perlindex.  Should go into it's own
  Tk::Text::Util.pm module

o after switching between case sensitive/insensitive highlightning
  should be updated immediately

o scrolling is not as exact as it shoule be (i.e. scroll forw, then
  scroll back will not get to the same position as before)

Tk::Pod::Cache

o use a LRU cache

o maybe do not cache small documents at all

o problem: change font size => back => cached document has still the
  old font sizes
