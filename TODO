=head1 TODO

Scratch pad of bugs, missing features, and misbehaviors
collected during I used tkpod.

=head2 BUGS

=head3 Tk::Pod

=over

=item *

SE<lt>E<gt> seems often to be ignored. May be a core Tk::Text bug (i.e.
C<< -wrap => "none" >> in tags being sometimes ignored)

=item *

PodText: interrupt process() if another file is loaded... Sometimes
strange things may happen like all text is underlined.

=item *

for Windows: check whether Tk::More/Tk::Tree match the system
background colors

=item *

maybe special handling for Tk::Pod::FindPods under Mac OS X is
necessary (pod directory is /System/Library/Perl/pods)

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Cache

=over

=item *

problem: change font size => back => cached document has still the
old font sizes

=back

=head2 WISHLIST

=head3 Tk::Pod

=over

=item *

cleanup search interface to perlindex. Maybe patch Ulrichs TPJ example
code for nroff pages to allow both POD and MAN.

=item *

add meaningful regression tests

=item *

use some kind of access control for the -s option

=item *

new menu entry with a link list (e.g. all LE<lt>...E<gt> and everything
looking like a module /\w+::\w+/)

=item *

maybe put the removed WWWBrowser code again to Tk::Pod::Text

=item *

option for interleaving POD and code

=back

=head3 Tk::More

=over

=item *

Tk/More status bar:  filename  %   line x

=item *

more 'more' like key bindings to Tk::More.

=item *

More.pm: search should scroll per page

=item *

search policies: regexp, glob, incremental (as in xmore)
and 'normalized' as in perlindex.  Should go into it's own
Tk::Text::Util.pm module

=item *

after switching between case sensitive/insensitive highlightning
should be updated immediately

=item *

scrolling is not as exact as it shoule be (i.e. scroll forw, then
scroll back will not get to the same position as before)

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Cache

=over

=item *

use a LRU cache

=item *

maybe do not cache small documents at all

=back
