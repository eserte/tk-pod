=head1 TODO

Scratch pad of bugs, missing features, and misbehaviors
collected during I used tkpod.

=head2 BUGS

=head3 Tk::Pod

=over

=item *

SE<lt>E<gt> seems often to be ignored. May be a core Tk::Text bug (i.e.
C<< -wrap => "none" >> in tags being sometimes ignored)

=item *

PodText: interrupt process() if another file is loaded... Sometimes
strange things may happen like all text is underlined.

=item *

for Windows: check whether Tk::More/Tk::Tree match the system
background colors

=item *

maybe special handling for Tk::Pod::FindPods under Mac OS X is
necessary (pod directory is /System/Library/Perl/pods)

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Cache

=over

=item *

problem: change font size => back => cached document has still the
old font sizes

=back

=head2 WISHLIST

=head3 Tk::Pod

=over

=item *

cleanup search interface to perlindex. Maybe patch Ulrichs TPJ example
code for nroff pages to allow both POD and MAN.

=item *

add meaningful regression tests

=item *

use some kind of access control for the -s option

=item *

new menu entry with a link list (e.g. all LE<lt>...E<gt> and everything
looking like a module /\w+::\w+/)

=item *

maybe put the removed WWWBrowser code again to Tk::Pod::Text

=item *

option for interleaving POD and code

=item *

show "No documentation found for "..."" if there's no pod in the file
(just like perldoc)

=back

=head3 Tk::More

=over

=item *

Tk/More status bar:  filename  %   line x

=item *

more 'more' like key bindings to Tk::More.

=item *

More.pm: search should scroll per page

=item *

search policies: regexp, glob, incremental (as in xmore)
and 'normalized' as in perlindex.  Should go into it's own
Tk::Text::Util.pm module

=item *

after switching between case sensitive/insensitive highlightning
should be updated immediately

=item *

scrolling is not as exact as it shoule be (i.e. scroll forw, then
scroll back will not get to the same position as before)

=item *

use Tk::HistEntry for search entry

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Cache

=over

=item *

use a LRU cache

=item *

maybe do not cache small documents at all

=item *

store modtime of POD files and flush cache automatically if the file
changed

=back

=head3 Tk::Pod::Tree

=over

=item *

Idea: add another category "perl functions". Subitems are functions
categories, the leafs are functions. Maybe use balloons to show short
description of categories and functions. On click show the output
generated by "perldoc -f". Implementation notes:

=over

=item use virtual name "perlfunc:

=item use Pod::Functions for the category and function lists (it's
part of the standard dist since when?)

=item can I use the output of perldoc -f verbatim or should it be fed
into a pod formatter?

=back

=item *

Should I include something similar for perlfaq (perldoc -q)? Maybe a
new menu item "Search FAQ"?

=item *

Implement C<-rememberopen> in C<Fill> method.
